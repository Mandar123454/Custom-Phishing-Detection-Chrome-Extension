## Introduction

The Custom Phishing Detection Chrome Extension is an advanced security tool that uses multiple detection techniques, including machine learning, heuristic analysis, and API integrations, to identify potential phishing websites and protect users while browsing. This documentation provides a comprehensive analysis of the extension's architecture, components, and functionality.

## Architecture Overview

The extension follows a modular architecture with the following main components:

1. **Background Service Worker**: Runs continuously to monitor browser activity
2. **Content Script**: Analyzes webpage content and DOM structure
3. **Machine Learning Model**: Processes extracted features to generate phishing scores
4. **API Integration Layer**: Communicates with external security services
5. **User Interface**: Popup interface and comprehensive dashboard

The extension uses Chrome's Extension API to interact with browser functions while maintaining a separation of concerns between different components.

2. **API Security**: Uses secure HTTPS for all API communications
3. **Data Minimization**: Only sends necessary information to external services
4. **Permission Control**: Requests only required permissions in manifest.json
5. **Update Verification**: Validates model updates before installation

## Performance Optimization

To ensure minimal impact on browsing experience:

1. **Lazy Loading**: Defers loading of non-critical components
2. **Incremental Processing**: Analyzes page content incrementally
3. **Caching**: Stores recent results to avoid redundant processing
4. **Efficient DOM Traversal**: Uses optimized selectors and traversal methods
5. **Background Processing**: Performs intensive operations in the background script
