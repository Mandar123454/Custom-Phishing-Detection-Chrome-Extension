**Author**: Mandar Kajbaje



## Executive Summary

This technical report details the development, implementation, and performance evaluation of the Custom Phishing Detection Chrome Extension, a browser-based security tool that identifies potential phishing websites using a combination of machine learning, heuristic analysis, and API integrations. The extension has achieved a 99.1% accuracy rate in phishing detection with minimal false positives through a multi-layered approach to threat analysis.

Key features include real-time URL and content analysis, in-browser machine learning using TensorFlow.js, integration with multiple security APIs, and a comprehensive dashboard for threat visualization and management. The extension demonstrates effective performance with minimal impact on browsing speed and memory usage.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Phishing attacks continue to be one of the most prevalent and effective cyber threats, with over 611,877 phishing sites detected in the first quarter of 2025 alone (APWG Phishing Activity Trends Report). Traditional phishing detection methods often rely on blocklists that quickly become outdated or require sending sensitive browsing data to remote servers, raising privacy concerns.

### 1.2 Project Objectives

1. Develop a browser extension that can detect phishing attempts in real-time
2. Implement a multi-layered detection approach combining heuristics and machine learning
3. Minimize privacy concerns by performing primary analysis locally in the browser
4. Provide clear, actionable information to users when threats are detected
5. Create a comprehensive dashboard for monitoring protection activity
6. Achieve >95% accuracy with a false positive rate below 1%

### 1.3 Technical Approach Overview

The extension implements a defense-in-depth strategy with the following components:

1. URL structure analysis using regex patterns and statistical features
2. DOM content examination to identify suspicious elements
3. SSL certificate validation
4. Local machine learning model using TensorFlow.js
5. Optional API integration for enhanced detection

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Feature Selection and Extraction

The extension extracts 28 distinct features from URLs and page content, selected based on their demonstrated correlation with phishing indicators:

**URL-based features:**
- Domain age and registration information
- Length of hostname and full URL
- Number of subdomains and dots
- Presence of IP addresses
- Use of URL shortening services
- Suspicious TLDs
- Character distribution and entropy
- Brand name presence in domain

**Content-based features:**
- Form submission target analysis
- Password field detection and context
- External resource loading patterns
- SSL certificate validity and properties
- JavaScript obfuscation detection
- Hidden element analysis
- Meta tag inspection
- Brand logo presence via image comparison

### 2.2 Machine Learning Model Development

#### 2.2.1 Dataset Preparation

The model was trained on a combined dataset of:
- 100,000 verified phishing URLs from PhishTank and APWG
- 150,000 legitimate URLs from Alexa Top Sites and Common Crawl
- URLs were processed to extract the feature set described in section 2.1

#### 2.2.2 Model Architecture

The chosen model architecture is a feed-forward neural network with:
- Input layer: 28 nodes (one per feature)
- Hidden layer 1: 16 nodes with ReLU activation
- Hidden layer 2: 8 nodes with ReLU activation
- Output layer: 1 node with sigmoid activation

This architecture was selected after comparing performance with alternative models including:
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines
- Gradient Boosting

#### 2.2.3 Training Process

Training was conducted using TensorFlow with the following parameters:
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss function: Binary cross-entropy
- Batch size: 64
- Epochs: 100
- Early stopping with patience of 10 epochs
- 80/20 train/validation split

#### 2.2.4 Model Optimization for Browser Deployment

The trained model was optimized for in-browser execution:
- Model quantization to reduce size
- Layer pruning to remove redundant connections
- Conversion to TensorFlow.js format
- Progressive loading implementation

### 2.3 API Integration Architecture

The extension integrates with external APIs using an asynchronous request architecture:

1. **Request Prioritization**: Requests are queued and prioritized based on:
   - User interaction with the current page
   - Potential risk level identified by local analysis
   - Available API quotas

2. **Rate Limiting**: Intelligent rate limiting prevents API quota exhaustion:
   - Local caching of recent results
   - Exponential backoff for repeated requests
   - Domain-based request coalescing

3. **Response Processing**: API responses are:
   - Normalized to a common format
   - Combined with local analysis results using a weighted approach
   - Cached for performance optimization

## 3. Implementation Details
